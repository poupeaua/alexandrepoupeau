#### The beginning of the Climate Regime

{{< mylink name="The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development" href="https://www.un.org/en/conferences/environment/rio1992" >}} (UNCED), also called the Earth Summit, is really important: 172 governments are represented, 117 heads of state are present and around 2400 NGO leaders are there too.

The conference addressed global issues such as fossil fuels, climate change, public transportation and more. At the end of the event various conventions and policies are produced like the {{< mylink name="Agenda 21" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21" >}}. The most important one is the {{< mylink name="Climate Change Convention" href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change" >}} (also called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or UNFCCC for short). This Convention was adopted the March 21st 1994 when 50 countries signed the convention. Even though **the Convention does not include any objectives** it ensures that governments gather every year to discuss Anthropocene issues in {{< mylink name="Conferences Of Parties" href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" >}} (COP).
