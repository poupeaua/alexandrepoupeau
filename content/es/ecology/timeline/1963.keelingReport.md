#### Connecting the dots : CO2 rise implies global temperature rise

Keeling's curve was rising year by year through the 1960s. In 1963, Keeling and a few other experts met at a conference sponsored by the private Conservation Foundation and issued a report suggesting that the doubling of CO2 projected for the next century could raise the world's temperature by 3.8Â°C.

{{< quote textQuote="It is estimated that a doubling of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere would produce an average atmospheric temperature rise of 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit. [...] So far, the increase of carbon dioxide has been of the order of 10 percent, and the oceans are already experiencing some rise of temperature." whoQuote="Noel Eichhorn associate of the Conservation Foundation" linkQuote="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015004619030&view=1up&seq=5"  srcQuote="Implications of rising carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere" infoQuote="March 1963, page 5/28, 2nd paragraph" >}}
