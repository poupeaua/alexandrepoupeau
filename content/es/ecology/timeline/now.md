#### Study, Share and Act

You can be a thinker, a maker, an instigator, an organiser or a facilitator (Arthur Keller - 2022).

**The important thing it to stop denying**. If we deeply understand we will act accordingly. Even though Naomi Klein is focused on climate change, this applies for the systemic concern:

<p>
A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a 
split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke ("more 
signs of the Apocalypse!"). Which is another way of looking away. <br><br>

Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever 
and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out 
of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover 
while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away. <br><br>

Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it ("dollar for dollar it's more 
efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is 
the best protection from weather extremes") — as if having a few more dollars will 
make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking 
away if you happen to be a policy wonk. <br><br>

Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant 
and abstract — even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, 
and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the 
most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way 
of looking away. <br><br>

Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate 
and shop at farmers' markets and stop driving — but forget trying to actually change 
the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that's too much "bad 
energy" and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, 
because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still 
have one eye tightly shut. <br><br>

Or maybe we do look — really look — but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. 
Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it's hard to keep it 
in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again 
ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that 
letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.
