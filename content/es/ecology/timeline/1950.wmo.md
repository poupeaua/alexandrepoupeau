#### Promoting a shared vision

The {{< mylink name="World Meteorological Organization" href="https://public.wmo.int/en/about-us"  >}} (WMO) is an institution created in 1950 that played a huge role in the emergence of the human-caused greenhouse effect question on the international scene. The WMO has three main objectives :

-   Harmonize norms and national pratices through international technical and scientific cooperation.
    
-   Build or reinforce the states' capacities to conduct their own research and to maintain a dedicated technological infrastructure.
    
-   Mobilize the international community around global concerns by promoting a shared vision.
