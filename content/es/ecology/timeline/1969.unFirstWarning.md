#### His thoughts about the systemic concern

{{< quote textQuote="I do not wish to seem overdramatic, but I can only conclude from the information that is available to me as Secretary-General, that the Members of the United Nations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to improve the human environment, to defuse the population explosion, and to supply the required momentum to development efforts. If such a global partnership is not forged within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control." whoQuote="U Thant Ex Secretary-General of the UN" linkQuote="https://search.archives.un.org/uploads/r/united-nations-archives/8/f/5/8f51042e61f063d4c22b74d7830bce0d3c592d3d7f9fce10b8f8d8c5e6cd8f7d/S-0888-0008-04-00001.pdf" srcQuote="Extracts from statements of Sessions of the UN General Assembly" infoQuote="May 1969 at page 8/47" >}}
