#### Maintaining peace and security

The {{< mylink name="United Nations" href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us"  >}} was created in 1945. This international organization was established right after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars however its role has extended to environmental concerns.

The United Nations has played a central role in the international environmental scene by:

-  Encouraging the creation of the {{< mylink name="World Meteorological Organization" href="https://public.wmo.int/en/about-us"  >}} in 1950
    
-  Organizing the {{< mylink name="Stockholm Conference" href="https://www.un.org/en/conferences/environment/stockholm1972"  >}}, the first international environmental conference in 1972 which resulted in the creation of the {{< mylink name="United Nations Environmental Programme" href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us"  >}} (UNEP).
    
-   Establishing the {{< mylink name="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/"  >}} (IPCC) in 1988.
    
-   Leading the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero which led to all the future Conferences Of Parties (COP).
