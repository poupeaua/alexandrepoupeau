#### Prediction of a Collapse of our Societies

This unmissable book - **it really is a must-read** - is a report of a two year study by the {{< mylink name="Massachusetts Institute of Technology" href="https://www.mit.edu/about/"  >}} (MIT) from 1970 to 1972. The project team used system dynamics theory and computer modeling to analyze, via a computer model named {{< mylink name="World3" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3"  >}}, the long-term causes and consequences of growth in the world's population and material economy. Their conclusions are unpleasant but must be read carefully:

{{< quote textQuote="If the present growths trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growths on this planet will be reached sometime within the next 100 years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrolled decline in both populaton and industrial capacity." whoQuote="Meadows & Randers" linkQuote="http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Limits-to-Growth-digital-scan-version.pdf" srcQuote="The Limits to Growth" infoQuote="1972" >}}

Here is a graph of a standard run of the World3 model:

Even though the book contains mainly the model's result based on different scenarios and their analysis, it contains some wise advice and tools. I would like to share one extract with you:

{{< quote textQuote="The depths of human ignorance are much more profound than most of us are willing to admit. [...] The world's leader do not know any better than anyone else how to bring about a sustainable society; most of them don't even know it's necessary to do so." whoQuote="Meadows & Randers" linkQuote="http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Limits-to-Growth-digital-scan-version.pdf" srcQuote="The Limits to Growth" infoQuote="1972" >}}
