#### A classic in ecological literature

The book was originally an ordered report for the Stockholm conference that occurred the year of its publication. The report already mentions the main concerns we are facing now : malnutrition, ocean acidification and more. Surprisingly, the 2째C global warming threshold already appears in this old report.

{{< quote textQuote="The equilibrium between incoming and outgoing radiation, the forces that preserve the global temperature seem so delicate, so precise, that a slight change in the energy equilibrium could disturb everything. Only a slight change can modify the global temperature to 2째C. 2째C less and it is a new ice age ; 2째C more and it is an age without ice. In both cases, the consequences are global and catastrophic." whoQuote="Ward and Dubos" linkQuote="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000074879/PDF/074879engo.pdf.multi" srcQuote="Only One Earth" infoQuote="1972" >}}
