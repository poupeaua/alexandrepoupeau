#### He says: "I do not want to lie anymore"

Nicolas Hulot was the Environment Minister from May 2017 to Sept. 2018. Quited was for him a way to protest. In his opinion, to prolong his mission would have been a synonym of resignation. Indeed, to prolong was like giving the illusion to people that we are going in the right direction.

I do not want people to believe that with limited means, we will be able to solve such complex equations. [...] If there is not a shared vision at the highest level, if the diagnostic is not shared, the treatment will not be shared." whoQuote="Nicolas Hulot ex-French Environment Minister" linkQuote="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJM1yI2wKY&ab_channel=Radio-CanadaInfo"  srcQuote="Radio-Canada Info interview" infoQuote="January 2019" >}}
