#### Oil market becomes global

In order to introduce some context, let me talk about {{< mylink name="The Petroleum Production Company Nobel Brothers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branobel"  >}} or simply _Branobel_ which is a contraction for "Nobel Brothers" in Russian. The Nobel's Oil company was founded in 1876 in Baku, today's capital of Azerbaïdjan. At some point in history, the _Branobel_ company was producing 50% of all the oil in the world.

In 1878, Ludvig Nobel, brother of Robert Nobel and of the certainly most well-known Alfred Nobel, ordered the first oil tanker in history called the {{< mylink name="Zoroaster" href="https://www.marineinsight.com/maritime-history/zoroaster-the-worlds-first-tanker-ship/"  >}} to a Swedish company. The ship was capable of transporting around 242 tons of kerosene.

In 1881, while loading a ship in Baku's port, a Zoroaster's sister-ship exploded, killing more than half of the crew and causing one of the first oil spills in history.

Other oil companies began to copy the _oil tanker idea_ and in 1889 the first Atlantic Crossing by a tanker ship was achieved, specifically conceived for transporting oil. This was a turning point in history: oil market became global.
