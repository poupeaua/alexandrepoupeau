Fred Vargas is mostly well-known for her crime novels however she wrote a transparent and really easy to read (even for neophytes) book about the systemic problems due to Anthropocene. The book is quite naive and its approach is sometimes confusing but it at least informs people about climate change, biodiversity destruction, energy and more.
