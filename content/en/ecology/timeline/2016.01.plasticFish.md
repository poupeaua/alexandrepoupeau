#### An unconceivable and monumentally absurd idea

A {{< mylink name="report" href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics" >}} published in January 19, 2016 estimated that there will be more plastic than fish by weight by 2050. The UN President of the 73rd Session reacted in June 2019 :

{{< quote textQuote="If we do nothing, by 2050, our world’s oceans will have more plastic in them than fish (by weight). I am going to repeat this, because it is an idea that appears monumentally absurd, but according to a report by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation, this is exactly the future we are headed toward: There will be more plastic than fish in the ocean in just over 30 years." whoQuote="María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly" linkQuote="https://www.un.org/pga/73/2019/06/05/op-ed-we-must-save-our-world-from-drowning-in-plastic" srcQuote="We Must Save Our World From Drowning in Plastic" infoQuote="Wednesday, June 5, 2019" >}}

Below is a diagram found on page 14 of the above-mentioned report, which gives us a schematic and straightforward description of the expected trends in plastics production in a business-as-usual scenario:
