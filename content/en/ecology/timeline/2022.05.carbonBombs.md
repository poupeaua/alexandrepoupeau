#### 425 Carbon Bombs worldwide

{{< quote textQuote="We have mapped the biggest fossil fuel projects worldwide, 425 carbon bombs, with a CO2 emissions potential exceeding 1 Gigaton in each project. The potential emissions from these projects exceed the 1.5 °C carbon budget by a factor of two. We showed that there is a high concentration of these projects in countries that have so far received little attention by those looking at the supply side of climate change mitigation: China, Middle Eastern countries and Russia. This is a major gap in mitigation policy and urgently needs to be addressed." whoQuote="Kjell Kühne, Nils Bartsch, Ryan Driskell Tate, Julia Higson and André Habet" linkQuote="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421522001756#sec5"  srcQuote="conclusion of the research paper “Carbon Bombs” - Mapping key fossil fuel projects" infoQuote="23 May 2022" >}}

For more information and insights, the website {{< mylink name="carbonbombs.org" href="https://www.carbonbombs.org">}}  gathers all the information relative to the 425 Carbon Bombs. There, you will be able to visualize where these Carbon Bombs are located on the world map and examine some graphics to better understand the diversity of actors (banks, insurances, energy companies) that threaten the habitability conditions of our planet.
