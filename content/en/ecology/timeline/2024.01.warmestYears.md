#### 2023 is the warmest year since global records

2023 is officially the warmest year ever recorded. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) makes it clear in its article {{< mylink name="Climate Change: Global Temperature" href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature">}} published on January 18, 2024. The important highlights are the following: 2023 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850 by a wide margin and worst than that, **the 10 warmest years in the historical record have all occurred in the past decade (2014-2023)**. You can find additional details by reading the NOAA {{< mylink name="2023 Global Climate Report" href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202313">}}.

Other reliable sources inform about the same news. Copernicus, which is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme and a leading provider of Earth observation data, produced an article named {{< mylink name="2023 is the hottest year on record" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record">}} published on January 9, 2024. Here is an interesting highsight: 2023 was 0.60째C warmer than the 1991-2020 average and 1.48째C warmer than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial level, which is very close to the 1.5째C limit.

We can also site the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) with its article {{< mylink name="WMO confirms that 2023 smashes global temperature record" href="https://wmo.int/media/news/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record">}} published on January 12, 2024.

The state of the Earth becomes so critical and climate inaction so absurd that we have not enough strong words to describe what is happening and what is about to happen. The UN Secretary-General is contrained to employ new words in order to try to catch the world's attention mentionning the "global boiling".

{{< quote textQuote="For scientists it is unequivocal humans are to blame. All of this is entirely consistent with predictions and repeated warnings. The only surprise is the speed of the change. The era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived. The air is unbreathable, the heat is unbearable and the level of fossil fuel profits and climate inaction is unacceptable." linkQuote="https://youtu.be/xyacrd1d-cU" whoQuote="Ant처nio Guterres UN Secretary-General" srcQuote="video message" infoQuote="27 July 2023" >}}

The following graph shows the Yearly Average Temperature Anomaly which is the difference between the average yearly global surface temperature and its pre-industrial baseline. The pre-industrial baseline is calculated as the average temperature from 1850 to 1900.
