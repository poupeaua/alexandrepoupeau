#### From Hopenhagen to Flopenhagen

There was hope before this conference. The event was even called _Hopenhagen_ but it unfortunately turned into _Flopenhagen_. Indeed with the election of Barack Obama at the end of 2009, there was hope for the United States to reintegrate the Kyoto Protocol but it was not the case.

*   China became the first emitter of CO2 emissions in the world (China exceeded USA in 2004 to be precise) but is still defending itself by hammering on the _historical responsability due to past emissions_ argument.
    
*   In its second report in 1995, IPCC mentioned that a 2째C global warming corresponds to 550 p.p.m. However in its fourth assessment report published in 2007, the IPCC reviewed their study and suggested that a 2째C global warming corresponds in fact to 450 p.p.m instead. The fact that the objective changed might have scared governments, plus in 2009 we had already reached 390 p.p.m.
    
*   The only result of this conference is a minimal document called the {{< mylink name="Copenhagen Accord" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord" >}} signed by around 30 nations that represented 80% of global emissions to recognize that climate change is one of the most important challenge of our time and needs to be adressed with a strong political will to avoid passing the 2째C threshold. **However, no quantified target or temporal policy is defined for the 2째C limit.**
