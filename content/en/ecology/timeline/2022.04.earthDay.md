#### The UN Secretary-General says that governments are lying to us

{{< quote textQuote="We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris. Some government and business leaders are saying one thing – but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic. This is a climate emergency. [...] Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness." whoQuote="António Guterres UN Secretary-General" linkQuote="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZRvli9fgQ"  srcQuote="video message" infoQuote="4 April 2022" >}}
