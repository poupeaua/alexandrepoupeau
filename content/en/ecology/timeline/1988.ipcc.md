#### Ensuring access to scientific knowledge on climate change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an organization that provides objective and comprehensive scientific information on anthropogenic climate change, including the natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and possible response options. It does not conduct original research nor monitor climate change, but rather undertakes a periodic, systematic review of all relevant published literature. Thousands of scientists and other experts volunteer to review the data and compile key findings into "Assessment Reports" for policymakers and the general public.

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the {{< mylink name="World Meteorological Organization" href="https://public.wmo.int/en/about-us" >}} (WMO) and the {{< mylink name="United Nations Environment Programme" href="https://www.unep.org/"  >}} (UNEP). It publishes assessment report around every 5 years and has published six assessment reports so far. Visit the {{< mylink name="IPCC Website" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" >}} to download and read their reports.

In 2007, the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize shared with Al Gore for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change. Please note that the organization only have around 6 millions dollars budget per year.
