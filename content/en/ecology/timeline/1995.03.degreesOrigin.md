#### Knowing where this limit comes from

To put it simply, the 2°C objective comes from a scientific-political coproduction with some major actors like the {{< mylink name="IPCC" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" >}} and the {{< mylink name="German Advisory Council on Climate Change" href="https://www.wbgu.de/en/" >}} (WBGU), an independent scientific advisory body established in the 1992 in the run-up to Rio Earth Summit.

In 1995, the WBGU proposed a logical and simple approach to determine the threshold that we should never pass. The WBGU claims that the temperature window should not exceed the temperature where biological and human life has been developped on Earth for the past 120000 years.

{{< quote textQuote="The first principle, preservation of Creation in its present form, is presented within this scenario in the form of a tolerable “temperature window”. This window is derived from the range of fluctuation for the Earth’s mean temperature in the late Quarternary period. This geological epoch has shaped our present-day environment, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the last ice age (mean minimum around 10.4 °C) and the highest temperatures during the last interglacial period (mean maximum around 16.1 °C). If this temperature range is exceeded in either direction, dramatic changes in the composition and function of today’s ecosystems can be expected. If we extend the tolerance range by a further 0.5 °C at either end, then the tolerable temperature window extends from 9.9 °C to 16.6 °C. Today’s global mean temperature is around 15.3 °C, which means that the temperature span to the tolerable maximum is currently only 1.3 °C." whoQuote="WBGU" linkQuote="https://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wbgu/publikationen/sondergutachten/sg1995/pdf/wbgu_sn1995_engl.pdf" srcQuote="Scenario for the derivation of global CO2 reduction targets and implementation strategies" infoQuote="page 12/45, March 1995" >}}

The 1.3°C degree maximum increase value combined with the 0.6°C global warming already observed in 1995 gives us the 2°C limit.
