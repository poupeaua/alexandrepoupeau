#### The Decline of _Black Gold_ around 2030

We have seen that according to the {{< mylink name="World Energy Outlook 2018" href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/77ecf96c-5f4b-4d0d-9d93-d81b938217cb/World_Energy_Outlook_2018.pdf" >}} report at page 45: "Global conventional crude oil production peaked in 2008 at 69.5 million barrils per day (mb/d) and has since fallen by around 2.5 mb/d.". Nonetheless, we have not seen any impacts or changes since 2008; no crisis occured like in 1973. Why ? This can be explained because of the production of unconventional oil which have counterbalanced the fall of conventional crude oil production since then. Let's see the difference between conventional and unconventional oil:

+ Conventional crude oil is the first type of oil ever exploited. Petroleum (crude oil, conventional crude oil) is found in the microscopic pores of sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and limestone.

+ Now what about the unconventional oil ? What are the different main types of unconventional oil ?
    - **fracking oil**, or more exactly hydrofracking also known as tight oil or shale oil
    - **tar sand**, also known as oil sand, bituminous sand which is a type of heavy oil or extra-heavy oil
    - **deep sea oil**, or offshore in the ocean and in the Arctic
    - **agrofuels**, also called biofuel
    - **natural gas liquids** (NGLs)

The **Global Peak Oil is predicted to occur around 2030** according to the {{< mylink name="World Energy Outlook 2023" href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/86ede39e-4436-42d7-ba2a-edf61467e070/WorldEnergyOutlook2023.pdf" >}} at page 133 (see figure 3.21). It is defined as the hypothetical point in time when the global production of oil - all types confounded - reaches its maximum rate, after which production will gradually decline.

Here is the description of the three different scenarios given by the World Energy Outlook 2023 at page 17: 
- **The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)**: provides an outlook based on the latest policy settings, including energy, climate and related industrial policies. 
- **The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS)**: assumes all national energy and climate targets made by governments are met in full and on time. 
- **The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)**: scenario required to meet the objectives to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.

These numbers confirm the vision of the CEO of Total back in 2020:

{{< quote textQuote="In 2050, when we speak about carbon neutrality in the second half of the century (reference to the Net Zero Emission or NZE scenario by 2050), we think that we’ll have something like 40 million barrils of oil per day (mb/d), but it’s not zero. It is much less than 100 million per day which is the current consumption. Clearly we will face a peak in oil production around 2030-2040, which will begin to decline." whoQuote="Patrick Pouyanné CEO of Total, Nature article" linkQuote="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WAJsK7_vVs&t=2271s" srcQuote="ONS Digital Conference" infoQuote="31 August 2020" >}}
