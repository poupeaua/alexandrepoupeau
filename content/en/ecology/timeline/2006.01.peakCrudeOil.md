#### The End of _Black Gold_ ?

According to the World Energy Outlook 2010, conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006, with an all-time maximum of 70 million barrels per day. Nonetheless, we have not seen any impacts or changes since 2006; no crisis occured. Why ? This is explained because of the production of tight oil which counterbalance the fall of crude oil production. However the global peak oil is announced to occur in around 2030 - 2040 according to the Total CEO.

{{< quote textQuote="In 2050 [...] we think that we’ll have something like 40 million b/d of oil per day, but it’s not zero. It is much less than 100 million per day which is the actual consumption. Clearly we will face a peak in oil production around 2030-2040, which will begin to decline." whoQuote="Patrick Pouyanné Total CEO, Nature article" linkQuote="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WAJsK7_vVs&t=2271s" srcQuote="ONS Digital Conference" infoQuote="31 August 2020" >}}
