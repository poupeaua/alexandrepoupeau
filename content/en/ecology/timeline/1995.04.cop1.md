#### The first Conference Of Parties

In 1995, the first COP took place in Berlin where 120 governments were represented. Even though the first IPCC report was released in 1990 and announced a possible 3Â°C global warming in 2050 compared to the pre-industrial era, the scientific alarm is not really taken seriously. **The conference did not end with concrete measures**.
