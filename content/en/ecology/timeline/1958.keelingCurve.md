#### Proof of the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere

The curve is named after the scientist Charles David Keeling who started the continuous CO2 monitoring program and supervised it from 1958 until his death in 2005.

I recommend to take a look at {{< mylink name="The Keeling Curve site" href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/"  >}} to explore interactively the different time ranges and see that the concentration of CO2 has exploded since the industrial revolution in 1850. For those that prefer to learn through videos, here is a great official one minute video from the Scripps Oceanography Institute: {{< mylink name="The Keeling Curve Hits 415 PPM video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z43FQCSg4Ow"  >}}
