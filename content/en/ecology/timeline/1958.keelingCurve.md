#### Proof of the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere

The curve is named after the scientist Charles David Keeling who started the continuous CO2 monitoring program and supervised it from 1958 until his death in 2005.

I recommend to take a look at {{< mylink name="The Keeling Curve site" href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/"  >}} to explore interactively the different time ranges and see that the concentration of CO2 has exploded since the industrial revolution in 1850. For those that prefer to learn through videos, here is a great official one minute video from the Scripps Oceanography Institute: {{< mylink name="The Keeling Curve Hits 415 PPM video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z43FQCSg4Ow"  >}}

I strongly want to hammer on the fact that the current CO2 concentration has nothing to do with a natural variation as you can see on the following graph.

For those wondering, we are able to know the CO2 concentration from hundreds of thousands of years ago thanks to ice core samples. Actually, we can also estimate the global past temperature too : Here is a {{< mylink name="video from the movie Chasing Ice" href="https://youtu.be/lHQ0pB68G_Y" >}} that explains the process quite simply.
