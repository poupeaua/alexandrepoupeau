#### NASA Visualization of Global Temperature Evolution

{{< youtube jWoCXLuTIkI >}}

This visualization shows monthly global temperature anomalies (changes from an average) between the years 1880 and 2021. Whites and blues indicate cooler temperatures, while oranges and reds show warmer temperatures. As you can see, global temperatures have warmed from mainly human activities as time has progressed.

These temperatures are based on data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). Anomalies are defined relative to a base period of 1951 to 1980.

In order to see more videos of the same kind but on other data, you can take a look at this site: {{<mylink name="Climate Lab Book" href="https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/">}}.
