Now comes the harder work in finding and producing oil from more challenging environments and work areas." whoQuote="William J.

Nonetheless, we have not seen any impacts or changes since 2008; no crisis occured like in 1973. Why ? This can be explained because of the production of unconventional oil which have counterbalanced the fall of conventional crude oil production since then.
