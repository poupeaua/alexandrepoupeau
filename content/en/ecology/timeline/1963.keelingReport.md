#### Connecting the dots : CO2 rise implies global temperature rise

Keeling's curve was rising year by year through the 1960s. In 1963, Keeling and a few other experts met at a conference sponsored by the private Conservation Foundation and issued a report suggesting that the doubling of CO2 projected for the next century could raise the world's temperature by 3.8 Fahrenheit or 2.1째C.

{{< quote textQuote="It is estimated that a doubling of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere would produce an average atmospheric temperature rise of 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit. [...] So far, the increase of carbon dioxide has been of the order of 10 percent, and the oceans are already experiencing some rise of temperature." whoQuote="Noel Eichhorn associate of the Conservation Foundation" linkQuote="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015004619030&view=1up&seq=5"  srcQuote="Implications of rising carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere" infoQuote="March 1963, page 5/28, 2nd paragraph" >}}

When they published this report back in 1963, there was an atmospheric C02 concentration of around 320 p.p.m. The report tells us that for 640 p.p.m we would reach an atmospheric temperature rise of 2.1째C. However, our scientific knowledge has evolved and we now know that 450 p.p.m most likely corresponds to 2.1째C and that 650 p.p.m most likely corresponds to 3.6째C. These estimations come from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group 1 - The Physical Science Basis, page 66/1007, Table TS.5).
