#### The most inappropriate material for its use

1907 is the year of birth of industrial plastic with the invention of bakelite. Other discoveries subsequently opened the door to more intensive use.

We, humans, have chosen to create a material that is highly durable for short-life or even single uses. Indeed, for example it takes around 450 years for a plastic bottle to be decomposed into microplastics that are even more dangerous than macroplastic because it enters the food chain. A {{< mylink name="review of differents studies" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.724989/full#B45" >}} suggests that humans may ingest an average of 0.1–5 g/week of microplastics up to 1 mm in size, or 74,000–121,000 particles per year. This information is confirmed by {{< mylink name="a WWF report" href="http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/plastic_ingestion_press_singles.pdf" >}}: the average person could ingest up to five grams of plastic each week through the polluted food and water they consume, the equivalent of a credit card.

In 2022, 400 millions tons of plastics were produced. The production is growing exponentially and is expected to double by 2040. Some estimates are unbelievable, for example annually we discard {{< mylink name="5 trillion plastic bags worldwide" href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/waste/plastic-bags-used-per-year" >}}. Plastic bags are used on average for 12 minutes but they persist in nature for 1000 years.
