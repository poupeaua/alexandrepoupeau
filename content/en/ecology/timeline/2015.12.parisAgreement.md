#### Lots of joy and promises

Paris Agreement aims to reach zero net CO2 emissions by 2050: is it even possible ? Well let us be realistic for 5 seconds, if we consider a net zero emission by 2100 then {{< mylink name="(see graph from Our World in Data)" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-mitigation-2c?time=1905..2100" >}}:

*   In the Copenhagen Conference back in 2009, an analysis was made that indicates that in order not to reach 2°C we needed to have a **3%** reduction of global emission of greenhouse gazes per year.
    
*   In 2013, a new analysis showed that to reach the same objective we needed to have a **5%** reduction of global emission of grenhouse gazes per year.
    
*   In 2022, a quick calculation indicates that we need a **9%** reduction per year for the exact same objective (check calculations below).
    

Unfortunately global emission have never decreased since 1850 (except during COVID19 crisis) and is still increasing exponentially.

For those interested in the calculations :

<div class="cmath"> `T_0 + \sum_{k=0}^{dy} \alpha * (1-p)^k = T_0 + \alpha * (1-(1-p)^(dy+1))/p < T_1`</div>
<div class="cmath"> `T_0 = 421`p.p.m is the current state in 2022</div>
<div class="cmath"> `T_1 = 450`p.p.m which corresponds to a global warming of 2°C</div>
<div class="cmath"> `\alpha = 2.5`p.p.m is the annual increase for our global emissions of 40Gt CO2 per year</div>
<div class="cmath"> `dy = 2100 - 2022` is the number of years we consider</div>
<div class="cmath"> `p` is the percentage to find</div>
