#### Air pollution contributes to 11.65% of deaths globally

The World Health Organization (WHO) published two fact sheets in 2021 that present the latest data:
- {{< mylink name="WHO – Fact sheet: Ambient (outdoor) air pollution" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health" >}}
- {{< mylink name="WHO – Fact sheet: Household (indoor) air pollution and health" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/household-air-pollution-and-health" >}}

According to estimates, air pollution kills 7 millions people each year and is one of the leading risk factors for death. In low-income countries, it is often very near the top of the list (or is the leading risk factor).

 Let us compare air pollution with some other main sources of mortality based on WHO estimates: high blood pressure causes 11 millions deaths each year, smoking 7.7 millions deaths, obesity 2.8 millions deaths, road accident 1.3 millions deaths, AIDS 680000 deaths, homicides 470000 deaths, wars 50000 and terrorism on average 25000 deaths. 
 
 Terrorism often dominates media coverage. We are informed about attacks as soon as they happen and many attacks claim the headlines. Close to 56 million people died in 2017; just over 26,000 of them from terrorism. Every 2000th death – 0.05% – were from terrorism.
