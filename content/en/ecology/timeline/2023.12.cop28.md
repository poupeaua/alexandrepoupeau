#### A Historic Deal

The 28th Conference of Parties was a scandal from the start for some people:

- it was organized in Dubaï United Arab Emirates (UAE), the 7th oil productor in the world.

- the president chosen for the 28th COP is the Sultan Al-Jaber; he is the Industry Minister of the UAE and the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). However, this company is aiming for a {{< mylink name="oil production capacity boost" href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/012522-adnoc-sets-up-debt-issuing-unit-amid-2030-plan-to-boost-oil-production-capacity">}} to 5 million b/d by 2030 from about 4 million b/d in 2022 (see also the International Trade Administration {{< mylink name="UAE Comercial Guide" href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/united-arab-emirates-oil-and-gas">}} published in November 25, 2023) which is a 25% oil production increase even though the 28th UN Climate Change Conference mentions: {{< mylink name="World agrees to transition away from fossil fuels and reduce global emissions by 43% by 2030" href="https://commission.europa.eu/news/un-climate-change-conference-world-agrees-transition-away-fossil-fuels-and-reduce-global-emissions-2023-12-13_en">}}.

- lots of companies that are considered as big polluters, representants and lobbyists were present. It was estimated that {{< mylink name="2456 lobbyists were present in the COP28" href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/2023/12/record-number-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-granted-access-cop28-climate-talks-0">}}, which is significantly more than in the COP27 with an estimation of 636 lobbyists and 503 during the COP26.

According to the Sultan Al-Jaber, the president of the COP28, the final text is a success.

{{< quote textQuote="It is an enhanced, balanced - but make no mistake - historic package to accelerate climate action." linkQuote="https://youtu.be/M1ocuCuV14g" whoQuote="Sultan Al-Jaber, COP28 President" srcQuote="Cop28 president hails 'historic' deal to transition away from fossil fuels youtube video" infoQuote="December 2023" >}}

This deal is called "historic" because it mentions, for the first time in all UN climate conferences, the {{< mylink name="transitioning away from fossil fuels" href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144742">}}. However, it is not enough, many people expected the term of "phase out" or at least "phase down".

{{< quote textQuote="The promises, if they were all fulfilled, would imply a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of around 5% by 2030, and those that are conditional only of 2%, whereas to limit global warming to well below 2°C, emissions would have to be reduced by 25%, or by 43% for 1.5°C. So we can also see a certain number of limits in this text. These limits are financing. Funding for the development of alternatives to fossil fuels, funding for adaptation with a global target that remains low, and funding for loss and damage to help the most vulnerable countries simply to rebuild post-disaster. For this, the $400 million on the table is equivalent to the annual salary of the three highest-paid footballers." linkQuote="https://youtu.be/A6t4HL-z5lQ&t=155" whoQuote="Valérie Masson-Delmotte, french climate scientist" srcQuote="interview post-COP28" infoQuote="December 13, 2023" >}}
