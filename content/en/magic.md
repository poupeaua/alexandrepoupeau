        title: Being a Card Artist
        info:             <p>I started doing card tricks when I was 17 years old. I have been practicing card tricks for more than 8 years now.</p>
            <p>It all started by taking a deck of playing cards and I fell in love with it instantaneously. I quickly bought my first Bicycle deck and then the story goes.</p>
            <p>Making card tricks was a new way for me to create and innovate. I have always loved creating my own card tricks and techniques.</p>
            <p><b>I have participated in more than 30 events now where I was engaged to do magic tricks.</b> They gave me experience and I now feel confident to produce card tricks in all kind of events.</p>
            <p class="mb-3"><b>I am capable of doing a 2 hours magic events with only different card tricks. Plus I am able to perform card tricks in French, English or Spanish !</b></p>
    teaching:
        title: Teaching Magic Card Tricks
        info:               <p>When I arrived in Grenoble in 2017, I found a magic club mostly dedicated in card tricks. the <i>Club de Magie de Grenoble INP</i> it was such a great opportunity for me to develop my skills and learn from others.<p>
            <p>During my three years of study in the engineering school Ensimag, I had the chance to participate to plenty of student events galas, ceremonies, parties and much more. This was possible because organizations and student associations are in contact with the Grenoble INP Magic Club.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in this club it was able to share my knowledge too. The magic club died unfortunately during COVID-19. It was inactive for two consecutive years. With the help of the previous secretary and president, we decided to bring it back to life in 2021-2022. I was responsible for the magic sessions every week, to ensure a good pedagogy for the newcomers and organize events.</p>
