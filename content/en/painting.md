    content1: "Painting is a way to take a step back from reality. It is also a great way to escape the grey and livid world we live in - especially for those living in cities - to add some more colors to it. Just take time for art."
    content2: "I am used to painting outside in Nature both watercolor and acrylic. I am just happy to share my paintings here with you and I hope it will make you want to start painting"
