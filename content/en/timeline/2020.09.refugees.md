#### Between 200 millions and 1.2 billion climate refugees by 2050

[_The Institute of Economics and Peace_](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/reports/) produces reports each year on different themes related to economics and peace. The ones we are particularly interested in are the _Ecological Threat Reports_ - one was published in 2020 and another in 2021.

Other estimations are much smaller. A [_World Bank Group publication_](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/09/13/climate-change-could-force-216-million-people-to-migrate-within-their-own-countries-by-2050) predicts around 200 millions climate refugees by 2050.
