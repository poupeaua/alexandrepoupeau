#### Turn Down the Heat

The report is called [_Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C Warmer World Must Be Avoided_](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/11860?locale-attribute=en) (available in English, French and Spanish). The funny fact is that it was written by an unexpected organization which we may consider as uninterested by the systemic crisis or even in part responsible of it: the World Bank. However, even their leaders realized that the crisis may be a problem for them. How surprising: a collapse of our societies implies no more financial needs.
