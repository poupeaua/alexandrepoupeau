#### A documentary film to educate people about global warming

Al Gore was back then the Vice President of the United States when he wrote the film _An Inconvenient Truth_ [(see trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu6SE5TYrCM&ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers). Thanks to his work he obtained a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for drawing the world's attention to the dangers of global warming which is the centerpiece in the film. I can not stress enough how much I recommend you to watch it.

The film shows brilliantly the link between the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and the global temperature anomaly on Earth from thousands of years ago. The following graph is used in the documentary :
