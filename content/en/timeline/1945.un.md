#### Maintaining peace and security

The [_United Nations_](https://www.un.org/en/about-us) was created in 1945. This international organization was established right after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars however its role has extended to environmental concerns.

The United Nations has played a central role in the international environmental scene by:

-  Encouraging the creation of the [_World Meteorological Organization_](https://public.wmo.int/en/about-us) in 1950
    
-  Organizing the [_Stockholm Conference_]( https://www.un.org/en/conferences/environment/stockholm1972), the first international environmental conference in 1972 which resulted in the creation of the [_United Nations Environmental Programme_](https://www.un.org/en/about-us) (UNEP)
    
-   Establishing the [_Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change_](https://www.ipcc.ch/) (IPCC) in 1988.
    
-   Leading the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero which led to all the future Conferences Of Parties (COP).
