#### Exposing environmental issues on the international scene

The [_Stockholm Conference_](https://www.un.org/en/conferences/environment/stockholm1972) is the first world conference on the environment. The UN was dedicated to make the environment a major issue.

One of the major results of the Stockholm conference was the creation of the [_United Nations Environmental Programme_](https://www.un.org/en/about-us) (UNEP) which is responsible for coordinating responses to environmental issues within the United Nations system.
