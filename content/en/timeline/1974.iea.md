#### Essential reports on Energy

The [_International Energy Agency_](https://www.iea.org/about/mission) (IEA) created in 1974 is well-known for its annual high quality reports on the question of energy called [_World Energy Outlook_](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/4ed140c1-c3f3-4fd9-acae-789a4e14a23c/WorldEnergyOutlook2021.pdf). The IEA provides an expertise to nations to help them formulate their energy policies and helps to frame the energy debate on a global scale.

Even though the World Energy Outlook are unmissable reports, I can only encourage you to take a look at different sources such as:

-   Statistical Review of World Energy - British Petroleum
    
-   Shell Energy Scenarios - Shell
    
-   World Energy Report - RWE
    
-   Energies - Total
    
-   Energy \[r\]evolution - Greenpeace
    

Beware, most estimations in those reports are _optimistic_ since most statistics come from private companies and the governments of oil producing countries that have no interest that the international community introduces measures for energy consumption reduction.
