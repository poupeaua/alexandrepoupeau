#### The first real but narrow objectives are set

The third COP took place in Kyoto in Japan in 1997 and concluded with the elaboration of the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol was opened for signatures in 1998 and came into effect in 2005 after 175 governments signed it - but not the United States which represented 36% of global emission in 1990. The Protocol specifies the 1992 Framework Convention by **assigning real emission reduction objectives for each signatory nation to reach before 2012 but without sanction mechanisms**.

In parallel, the Kyoto Protocol proposes a European bubble mechanism plus {{< mylink name="three flexible mechanisms" href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms" >}} to facilitate the emission reduction objectives:

*   European Bubble: European countries must reduce their emissions by 8%, however if a country is having difficulties to reduce their emissions, it is fine as long as another European country counterbalances by reducing their emissions more. This can be seen as a great group mechanism but it does not motivate each country to reduce their own emissions.
    
*   {{< mylink name="Clean Development Mechanism" href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism" >}} (CDM)
    
*   {{< mylink name="Joint Implementation" href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/joint-implementation" >}} (JI)
    
*   {{< mylink name="Emission Trading" href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/emissions-trading" >}} (ET): it allows purchase and selling of emissions quotas between countries.
    

These mechanisms can be criticised; they turn the real concern which is the future of humanity, more generally the life condition of living creatures and the habitability condition on Earth into a new economic shape called _The Economization of Environment_. This was denounced by NGOs and organizations.

Was the Kyoto Protocol a success in the end ? {{< mylink name="This Nature article provides an answer" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/491656a" >}}:

The result seems ok nonetheless, on a global scale, the Kyoto Protocol is not a success: global emissions have never stopped rising.

It was supposed to be the premice for real and stronger objectives but it proves to be already too difficult for governments to respect - see the {{< mylink name="Canada's withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-16151310#:~:text=Canada%20will%20formally%20withdraw%20from,failing%20to%20meet%20its%20targets." >}}.
