#### An economist ahead of its time

"*Are we wise* in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point at which we can long maintain it?" asked rhetorically the british economist Stanley Jevons in 1865 in his book {{< mylink href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&pg=GBS.PR2&hl=fr" name="The Coal Question: An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines" >}}. Mr Jevons was a visionnary, indeed he was already conscious of three important points:

- **The limit of ressources given their finite nature**: in this case Jevons is focused on coal however this assessment is true for all finite ressources. Even if it seems obvious, Jevons is one of the first economist to talk about the finitude of ressources.

- **{{< mylink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation)" name="The Rebound Effect" >}}**: "Whatever, therefore, conduces to increase the efficiency of coal, and to diminish the cost of its use, directly tends to augment the value of the steam-engine, and to enlarge the field of its operations."

- **The increasing dependance to energy**: "It is the material energy of the country — the universal aid — the factor in everything we do." Jevons further argue that coal is the source of the UK's prosperity and global dominance.

A study suggests that based on our current rates of production, {{< mylink href="https://www.worldometers.info/coal/" name="coal will be exhausted around 2150" >}} coal will be exhausted around 2150 according to World Coal Association - we should leave most of the coal discovered underground unfortunately! Jevons was wrong for coal but his global reasoning and conclusions are much more important than his prediction error.
