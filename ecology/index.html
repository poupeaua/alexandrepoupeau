                            <h4>Oil market becomes global</h4>
                            <p>In order to introduce some context, let me talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branobel" target="_blank"><i>The Petroleum Production Company Nobel Brothers</i></a> or simply <i>Branobel</i> which is a contraction for "Nobel Brothers" in Russian. The Nobel's Oil company was founded in 1876 in Baku, today's capital of Azerbaïdjan. At some point in history, the <i>Branobel</i> company was producing 50% of all the oil in the world.</p>
                            <p>In 1878, Ludvig Nobel, brother of Robert Nobel and of the certainly most well-known Alfred Nobel, ordered the first oil tanker in history called the <a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/maritime-history/zoroaster-the-worlds-first-tanker-ship/" target="_blank"><i>Zoroaster</i></a> to a Swedish company. The ship was capable of transporting around 242 tons of kerosene.</p>
                            <p>In 1881, while loading a ship in Baku's port, a Zoroaster's sister-ship exploded, killing more than half of the crew and causing one of the first oil spills in history.</p>
                            <p>Other oil companies began to copy the <i>oil tanker idea</i> and in 1889 the first Atlantic Crossing by a tanker ship was achieved, specifically conceived for transporting oil. This was a turning point in history: oil market became global.</p>

                                    which to subordinate their ancient
                                    quarrels and launch a global partnership
                                    to curb the arms race, to improve the

                                The project team used system dynamics theory and computer modeling to analyze, via a computer model named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3" target="_blank"><i>World3</i></a>, the long-term causes and consequences of growth in the world's population and material economy.
                                Their conclusions are unpleasant but must be read carefully:</p>

                              <p>For those wondering what sustainable development means and implies, I would like to introduce Herman Daly, a co-nominee for the Peace Prize due to his revelation that the current economic system is leading to ecological collapse. He is emeritus professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy. He was Senior Economist in the Environment Department of the World Bank too.
                                He had a major impact on the world by identifying indicators that are essential for a sustainable human society that are well known as <a href="https://np4sd.org/about/herman-daly/" target="_blank"><i>Herman Daly’s Three Rules</i></a>:

                              <h4>Ensuring access to scientific knowledge on climate change</h4>
                              <p>The IPCC provides objective and comprehensive scientific information on anthropogenic climate change, including the natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and possible response options. It does not conduct original research nor monitor climate change, but rather undertakes a periodic, systematic review of all relevant published literature. Thousands of scientists and other experts volunteer to review the data and compile key findings into "Assessment Reports" for policymakers and the general public.</p>
                              <p>The IPCC was established in 1988 by the <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/about-us" target="_blank"><i>World Meteorological Organization</i></a> (WMO) and the  <a href="https://www.unep.org/" target="_blank"><i>United Nations Environment Programme</i></a> (UNEP). It publishes assessment report around every 5 years and has published six assessment reports so far. Visit the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank"><i>IPCC Website</i></a> to download and read their reports.</p>
                              <p>In 2007, the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize shared with Al Gore for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change. Please note that the organization only have around 6 millions dollars budget per year.</p>

                              <p>The conference addressed global issues such as fossil fuels, climate change, public transportation and more. At the end of the event various conventions and policies are produced like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21" target="_blank"><i>Agenda 21</i></a>.

                                Even though <b>the Convention does not include any objectives</b> it ensures that governments gather every year to discuss Anthropocene issues in <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" target="_blank"><i>Conferences Of Parties</i></a> (COP).</p>

                            <p>To put it simply, the 2°C objective comes from a scientific-political coproduction with some major actors like the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank"><i>IPCC</i></a> and the <a href="https://www.wbgu.de/en/" target="_blank"><i>German Advisory Council on Climate Change</i></a> (WBGU), an independent scientific advisory body established in the 1992 in the run-up to Rio Earth Summit. 
                            <p>In 1995, the WBGU proposed a logical and simple approach to determine the threshold that we should never pass. The WBGU claims that the temperature window should not exceed the temperature where biological and human life has been developped on Earth for the past 120000 years.</p>

                                  <p>The first principle, preservation of Creation in its present form, is presented
                                    within this scenario in the form of a tolerable “temperature window”. This
                                    window is derived from the range of fluctuation for the Earth’s mean
                                    temperature in the late Quarternary period. This geological epoch has shaped
                                    our present-day environment, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the
                                    last ice age (mean minimum around 10.4 °C) and the highest temperatures
                                    during the last interglacial period (mean maximum around 16.1 °C). If this
                                    temperature range is exceeded in either direction, dramatic changes in the
                                    composition and function of today’s ecosystems can be expected. If we
                                    extend the tolerance range by a further 0.5 °C at either end, then the
                                    tolerable temperature window extends from 9.9 °C to 16.6 °C. Today’s global
                                    mean temperature is around 15.3 °C, which means that the temperature span
                                    to the tolerable maximum is currently only 1.3 °C.</p>

                              <p>The third COP took place in Kyoto in Japan in 1997 and concluded with the elaboration of the Kyoto Protocol. 
                                The Protocol was opened for signatures in 1998 and came into effect in 2005 after 175 governments signed it - but not the United States which represented 36% of global emission in 1990. 
                                The Protocol specifies the 1992 Framework Convention by <b>assigning real emission reduction objectives for each signatory nation to reach before 2012 but without sanction mechanisms</b>.</p>
                              <p>In parallel, the Kyoto Protocol proposes a European bubble mechanism plus <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms" target="_blank"><i>three flexible mechanisms</i></a> to facilitate the emission reduction objectives:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><p>European Bubble: European countries must reduce their emissions by 8%, however if a country is having difficulties to reduce their emissions, it is fine as long as another European country counterbalances by reducing their emissions more. This can be seen as a great group mechanism but it does not motivate each country to reduce their own emissions.</p></li>
                                <li><p><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism" target="_blank"><i>Clean Development Mechanism</i></a> (CDM)</p></li>

                              <p>These mechanisms can be criticised; they turn the real concern which is the future of humanity, more generally the life condition of living creatures and the habitability condition on Earth into a new economic shape called <i>The Economization of Environment</i>. 
                                This was denounced by NGOs and organizations.</p>
                              <p>Was the Kyoto Protocol a success in the end ? <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/491656a" target="_blank"><i>This Nature article provides an answer</i></a>: </p>

                              <p>The result seems ok nonetheless, on a global scale, the Kyoto Protocol is not a success: global emissions have never stopped rising. 
                                It was supposed to be the premice for real and stronger objectives but it proves to be already too difficult for governments to respect - see the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-16151310#:~:text=Canada%20will%20formally%20withdraw%20from,failing%20to%20meet%20its%20targets." target="_blank"><i>Canada's withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol</i></a>.</p>

The conference included the COP11, and was the first Meeting of the Parties (MOP1) to the Kyoto Protocol since their initial meeting in Kyoto in 1997.</p>
                             <p>The conference was one of the largest intergovernmental conferences on climate change ever. The event marked the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on 16 February 2005. Hosting more than 10,000 delegates, it was one of Canada's largest international events ever and the largest gathering in Montreal since Expo 67.</p>

                              <p>According to the World Energy Outlook 2010, conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006, with an all-time maximum of 70 million barrels per day. Nonetheless, we have not seen any impacts or changes since 2006; no crisis occured. Why ? This is explained because of the production of tight oil which counterbalance the fall of crude oil production. However the global peak oil is announced to occur in around 2030 - 2040 according to the Total CEO.</p>

                            <p>Al Gore was back then the Vice President of the United States when he wrote the film <i>An Inconvenient Truth </i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu6SE5TYrCM&ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers" target="_blank">(see trailer)</a>. Thanks to his work he obtained a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for drawing the world's attention to the dangers of global warming which is the centerpiece in the film. I can not stress enough how much I recommend you to watch it.</p>
                            <p>The film shows brilliantly the link between the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and the global temperature anomaly on Earth from thousands of years ago. The following graph is used in the documentary :</p>

                              <p>Paris Agreement aims to reach zero net CO2 emissions by 2050: is it even possible ? Well let us be realistic for 5 seconds, if we consider a net zero emission by 2100 then (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-mitigation-2c?time=1905..2100" target="_blank"><i>see graph from Our World in Data</i></a>):</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li><p>In the Copenhagen Conference back in 2009, an analysis was made that indicates that in order not to reach 2°C we needed to have a <b>3%</b> reduction of global emission of greenhouse gazes per year.</p></li>
                                <li><p>In 2013, a new analysis showed that to reach the same objective we needed to have a <b>5%</b> reduction of global emission of grenhouse gazes per year.</p></li>
                                <li><p>In 2022, a quick calculation indicates that we need a <b>9%</b> reduction per year for the exact same objective (check calculations below).</p></li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Unfortunately global emission have never decreased since 1850 (except during COVID19 crisis) and is still increasing exponentially.</p>

                              <p><b>The important thing it to stop denying</b>. If we deeply understand we will act accordingly. Even though Naomi Klein is focused on climate change, this applies for the systemic concern:</p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                      A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a 
                                      split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke ("more 
                                      signs of the Apocalypse!"). Which is another way of looking away. <br><br>

                                      Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever 
                                      and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out 
                                      of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover 
                                      while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away. <br><br>

                                      Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it ("dollar for dollar it's more 
                                      efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is 
                                      the best protection from weather extremes") — as if having a few more dollars will 
                                      make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking 
                                      away if you happen to be a policy wonk. <br><br>

                                      Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant 
                                      and abstract — even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, 
                                      and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the 
                                      most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way 
                                      of looking away. <br><br>

                                      Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate 
                                      and shop at farmers' markets and stop driving — but forget trying to actually change 
                                      the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that's too much "bad 
                                      energy" and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, 
                                      because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still 
                                      have one eye tightly shut. <br><br>

                                      Or maybe we do look — really look — but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. 
                                      Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it's hard to keep it 
                                      in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again 
                                      ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that 
                                      letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.
