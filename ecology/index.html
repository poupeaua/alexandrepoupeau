<p>&ldquo;<em>Are we wise</em> in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point at which we can long maintain it?&rdquo; asked rhetorically the british economist Stanley Jevons in 1865 in his book <a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gAAKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PR2&amp;hl=fr" target="_blank">
    <i>
     The Coal Question: An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines 
    </i>
</a>
. Mr Jevons was a visionnary, indeed he was already conscious of three important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The limit of ressources given their finite nature</strong>: in this case Jevons is focused on coal however this assessment is true for all finite ressources. Even if it seems obvious, Jevons is one of the first economist to talk about the finitude of ressources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_%28conservation%29" target="_blank">
    <i>
     The Rebound Effect 
    </i>
</a>
</strong>: &ldquo;Whatever, therefore, conduces to increase the efficiency of coal, and to diminish the cost of its use, directly tends to augment the value of the steam-engine, and to enlarge the field of its operations.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The increasing dependance to energy</strong>: &ldquo;It is the material energy of the country — the universal aid — the factor in everything we do.&rdquo; Jevons further argue that coal is the source of the UK&rsquo;s prosperity and global dominance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A study suggests that based on our current rates of production, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coal/" target="_blank">
    <i>
     coal will be exhausted around 2150 
    </i>
</a>
 according to World Coal Association - we should leave most of the coal discovered underground unfortunately! Jevons was wrong for coal but his global reasoning and conclusions are much more important than his prediction error.</p>

<p>In order to introduce some context, let me talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branobel" target="_blank">
    <i>
     The Petroleum Production Company Nobel Brothers 
    </i>
</a>
 or simply <em>Branobel</em> which is a contraction for &ldquo;Nobel Brothers&rdquo; in Russian. The Nobel&rsquo;s Oil company was founded in 1876 in Baku, today&rsquo;s capital of Azerbaïdjan. At some point in history, the <em>Branobel</em> company was producing 50% of all the oil in the world.</p>
<p>In 1878, Ludvig Nobel, brother of Robert Nobel and of the certainly most well-known Alfred Nobel, ordered the first oil tanker in history called the <a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/maritime-history/zoroaster-the-worlds-first-tanker-ship/" target="_blank">
    <i>
     Zoroaster 
    </i>
</a>
 to a Swedish company. The ship was capable of transporting around 242 tons of kerosene.</p>
<p>In 1881, while loading a ship in Baku&rsquo;s port, a Zoroaster&rsquo;s sister-ship exploded, killing more than half of the crew and causing one of the first oil spills in history.</p>
<p>Other oil companies began to copy the <em>oil tanker idea</em> and in 1889 the first Atlantic Crossing by a tanker ship was achieved, specifically conceived for transporting oil. This was a turning point in history: oil market became global.</p>

<p>1907 is the year of birth of industrial plastic with the invention of bakelite. Other discoveries subsequently opened the door to more intensive use.</p>
<p>We, humans, have chosen to create a material that is highly durable for short-life or even single uses. Indeed, for example it takes around 450 years for a plastic bottle to be decomposed into microplastics that are even more dangerous than macroplastic because it enters the food chain. A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.724989/full#B45" target="_blank">
    <i>
     review of differents studies 
    </i>
</a>
 suggests that humans may ingest an average of 0.1–5 g/week of microplastics up to 1 mm in size, or 74,000–121,000 particles per year. This information is confirmed by <a href="http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/plastic_ingestion_press_singles.pdf" target="_blank">
    <i>
     a WWF report 
    </i>
</a>
: the average person could ingest up to five grams of plastic each week through the polluted food and water they consume, the equivalent of a credit card.</p>
<p>In 2022, 400 millions tons of plastics were produced. The production is growing exponentially and is expected to double by 2040. Some estimates are unbelievable, for example annually we discard <a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/waste/plastic-bags-used-per-year" target="_blank">
    <i>
     5 trillion plastic bags worldwide 
    </i>
</a>
. Plastic bags are used on average for 12 minutes but they persist in nature for 1000 years.</p>

<p>I strongly want to hammer on the fact that the current CO2 concentration has nothing to do with a natural variability as you can see on the following graph.</p>

<p>For those wondering, we are able to know the CO2 concentration from hundreds of thousands of years ago thanks to ice core samples. Actually, we can also estimate the global past temperature too : Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/lHQ0pB68G_Y" target="_blank">

<p>Keeling&rsquo;s curve was rising year by year through the 1960s. In 1963, Keeling and a few other experts met at a conference sponsored by the private Conservation Foundation and issued a report suggesting that the doubling of CO2 projected for the next century could raise the world&rsquo;s temperature by 3.8 Fahrenheit or 2.1°C.</p>
<figure class="bg-primary p-3 rounded text-white">
    <blockquote>
        <p>"It is estimated that a doubling of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere would produce an average atmospheric temperature rise of 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit. [...] So far, the increase of carbon dioxide has been of the order of 10 percent, and the oceans are already experiencing some rise of temperature."</p>

<p>When they published this report back in 1963, there was an atmospheric C02 concentration of around 320 p.p.m. The report tells us that for 640 p.p.m we would reach an atmospheric temperature rise of 2.1°C. However, our scientific knowledge has evolved and we now know that 450 p.p.m most likely corresponds to 2.1°C and that 650 p.p.m most likely corresponds to 3.6°C. These estimations come from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group 1 - <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2020/02/ar4-wg1-sum_vol_en.pdf" target="_blank">

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an organization that provides objective and comprehensive scientific information on anthropogenic climate change, including the natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and possible response options. It does not conduct original research nor monitor climate change, but rather undertakes a periodic, systematic review of all relevant published literature. Thousands of scientists and other experts volunteer to review the data and compile key findings into &ldquo;Assessment Reports&rdquo; for policymakers and the general public.</p>
<p>The IPCC was established in 1988 by the <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/about-us" target="_blank">

 (WBGU), an independent scientific advisory body established in the 1992 in the run-up to Rio Earth Summit.</p>
<p>In 1995, the WBGU proposed a logical and simple approach to determine the threshold that we should never pass. The WBGU claims that the temperature window should not exceed the temperature where biological and human life has been developped on Earth for the past 120000 years.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The first principle, preservation of Creation in its present form, is presented within this scenario in the form of a tolerable “temperature window”. This window is derived from the range of fluctuation for the Earth’s mean temperature in the late Quarternary period. This geological epoch has shaped our present-day environment, with the lowest temperatures occurring in the last ice age (mean minimum around 10.4 °C) and the highest temperatures during the last interglacial period (mean maximum around 16.1 °C). If this temperature range is exceeded in either direction, dramatic changes in the composition and function of today’s ecosystems can be expected. If we extend the tolerance range by a further 0.5 °C at either end, then the tolerable temperature window extends from 9.9 °C to 16.6 °C. Today’s global mean temperature is around 15.3 °C, which means that the temperature span to the tolerable maximum is currently only 1.3 °C."</p>

<p>In 1997, Captain Charles Moore discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP)&ndash; a whirlpool of plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean. This is the biggest accumulation of plastic in a ocean gyre. It extends over 3 millions km2 or 6 times the area of France.</p>
<p>Plastic we create unfortunately ends up in the ocean. According to a <a href="https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_impacts_of_plastic_pollution_on_biodiversity.pdf" target="_blank">
    <i>
     WWF report 
    </i>
</a>
, between 86-150 million metric tonnes (MMT) of plastic have accumulated in the oceans in 2022, at a continuously increasing rate: in 2010, 4.8-12.7 MMT of plastic waste pollution were estimated to enter the ocean from land, while a more recent study suggests that 19-23 MMT entered our waterways in 2016. 80 percent of plastic in the ocean is estimated to come from land-based sources, with the remaining 20 percent coming from boats and other marine sources. This plastic accumulates in five ocean gyres. All five have an increased concentration of plastic waste compared to other parts of the oceans.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these plastic particles can barely be seen with the naked eye because they are microplastics (smaller than five millimeters). The gyres, however, do not feature floating islands of plastic, also called garbage patches. There is no visible floating mass of plastic waste in the middle of the ocean. Such misunderstandings persist, but pollution in the gyres is really an increased concentration of plastic that is, for the most part, in very small pieces.</p>
<p>We estimate that 100000 marine animals and one million seabirds die each year by ocean plastic ingestion or entanglement.</p>

<p>The third COP took place in Kyoto in Japan in 1997 and concluded with the elaboration of the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol was opened for signatures in 1998 and came into effect in 2005 after 175 governments signed it - but not the United States which represented 36% of global emission in 1990. The Protocol specifies the 1992 Framework Convention by <strong>assigning real emission reduction objectives for each signatory nation to reach before 2012 but without sanction mechanisms</strong>.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Kyoto Protocol proposes a European bubble mechanism plus <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms" target="_blank">
    <i>
     three flexible mechanisms 
    </i>
</a>
 to facilitate the emission reduction objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>European Bubble: European countries must reduce their emissions by 8%, however if a country is having difficulties to reduce their emissions, it is fine as long as another European country counterbalances by reducing their emissions more. This can be seen as a great group mechanism but it does not motivate each country to reduce their own emissions.</p>

<p>These mechanisms can be criticised; they turn the real concern which is the future of humanity, more generally the life condition of living creatures and the habitability condition on Earth into a new economic shape called <em>The Economization of Environment</em>. This was denounced by NGOs and organizations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we have not seen any impacts or changes since 2008; no crisis occured like in 1973. Why ? This can be explained because of the production of unconventional oil which have counterbalanced the fall of conventional crude oil production since then.

<p>There was hope before this conference. The event was even called <em>Hopenhagen</em> but it unfortunately turned into <em>Flopenhagen</em>. Indeed with the election of Barack Obama at the end of 2009, there was hope for the United States to reintegrate the Kyoto Protocol but it was not the case.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>China became the first emitter of CO2 emissions in the world (China exceeded USA in 2004 to be precise) but is still defending itself by hammering on the <em>historical responsability due to past emissions</em> argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In its second report in 1995, IPCC mentioned that a 2°C global warming corresponds to 550 p.p.m. However in its fourth assessment report published in 2007, the IPCC reviewed their study and suggested that a 2°C global warming corresponds in fact to 450 p.p.m instead. The fact that the objective changed might have scared governments, plus in 2009 we had already reached 390 p.p.m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only result of this conference is a minimal document called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord" target="_blank">
    <i>
     Copenhagen Accord 
    </i>
</a>
 signed by around 30 nations that represented 80% of global emissions to recognize that climate change is one of the most important challenge of our time and needs to be adressed with a strong political will to avoid passing the 2°C threshold. <strong>However, no quantified target or temporal policy is defined for the 2°C limit.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the Copenhagen Conference back in 2009, an analysis was made that indicates that in order not to reach 2°C we needed to have a <strong>3%</strong> reduction of global emission of greenhouse gazes per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2013, a new analysis showed that to reach the same objective we needed to have a <strong>5%</strong> reduction of global emission of grenhouse gazes per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022, a quick calculation indicates that we need a <strong>9%</strong> reduction per year for the exact same objective (check calculations below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately global emission have never decreased since 1850 (except during COVID19 crisis) and is still increasing exponentially.</p>

<p>There are only 14 IPCC special reports currently. They are intended to specify some elements that could not have been made in other reports. IPCC considered it useful to publish a special report on the theme of Global Warming 1.5°C because they thought it could help understand that this threshold is already critical and to be avoided: <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/" target="_blank">

<p>Keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5°C is actually highly unlikely given the trend in C02 emissions since 1850 as shown in the following graph:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>According to estimates, air pollution kills 7 millions people each year and is one of the leading risk factors for death. In low-income countries, it is often very near the top of the list (or is the leading risk factor).</p>


 <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor" width="100%" height="600rem"></iframe>

<p>Let us compare air pollution with some other main sources of mortality based on WHO estimates: high blood pressure causes 11 millions deaths each year, smoking 7.7 millions deaths, obesity 2.8 millions deaths, road accident 1.3 millions deaths, AIDS 680000 deaths, homicides 470000 deaths, wars 50000 and terrorism on average 25000 deaths.</p>
<p>Terrorism often dominates media coverage. We are informed about attacks as soon as they happen and many attacks claim the headlines. Close to 56 million people died in 2017; just over 26,000 of them from terrorism. Every 2000th death – 0.05% – were from terrorism.</p>

<p>This visualization shows monthly global temperature anomalies (changes from an average) between the years 1880 and 2021. Whites and blues indicate cooler temperatures, while oranges and reds show warmer temperatures. As you can see, global temperatures have warmed from mainly human activities as time has progressed.</p>
<p>These temperatures are based on data from NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). Anomalies are defined relative to a base period of 1951 to 1980.</p>

 report at page 45: &ldquo;Global conventional crude oil production peaked in 2008 at 69.5 million barrils per day (mb/d) and has since fallen by around 2.5 mb/d.&rdquo;. Nonetheless, we have not seen any impacts or changes since 2008; no crisis occured like in 1973. Why ? This can be explained because of the production of unconventional oil which have counterbalanced the fall of conventional crude oil production since then. Let&rsquo;s see the difference between conventional and unconventional oil:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conventional crude oil is the first type of oil ever exploited. Petroleum (crude oil, conventional crude oil) is found in the microscopic pores of sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone and limestone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now what about the unconventional oil ? What are the different main types of unconventional oil ?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fracking oil</strong>, or more exactly hydrofracking also known as tight oil or shale oil</li>
<li><strong>tar sand</strong>, also known as oil sand, bituminous sand which is a type of heavy oil or extra-heavy oil</li>
<li><strong>deep sea oil</strong>, or offshore in the ocean and in the Arctic</li>
<li><strong>agrofuels</strong>, also called biofuel</li>
<li><strong>natural gas liquids</strong> (NGLs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Global Peak Oil is predicted to occur around 2030</strong> according to the <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/86ede39e-4436-42d7-ba2a-edf61467e070/WorldEnergyOutlook2023.pdf" target="_blank">

 at page 133 (see figure 3.21). It is defined as the hypothetical point in time when the global production of oil - all types confounded - reaches its maximum rate, after which production will gradually decline.</p>
<p><img src="/img/ecology/timelines/main/weo-2023-oil-production-upto-2050.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the description of the three different scenarios given by the World Energy Outlook 2023 at page 17:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)</strong>: provides an outlook based on the latest policy settings, including energy, climate and related industrial policies.</li>
<li><strong>The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS)</strong>: assumes all national energy and climate targets made by governments are met in full and on time.</li>
<li><strong>The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)</strong>: scenario required to meet the objectives to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>These numbers confirm the vision of the CEO of Total back in 2020:</p>
<figure class="bg-primary p-3 rounded text-white">
    <blockquote>
        <p>"In 2050, when we speak about carbon neutrality in the second half of the century (reference to the Net Zero Emission or NZE scenario by 2050), we think that we’ll have something like 40 million barrils of oil per day (mb/d), but it’s not zero. It is much less than 100 million per day which is the current consumption. Clearly we will face a peak in oil production around 2030-2040, which will begin to decline."</p>

<p>The 28th Conference of Parties was a scandal from the start for some people:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it was organized in Dubaï United Arab Emirates (UAE), the 7th oil productor in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the president chosen for the 28th COP is the Sultan Al-Jaber; he is the Industry Minister of the UAE and the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). However, this company is aiming for a <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/012522-adnoc-sets-up-debt-issuing-unit-amid-2030-plan-to-boost-oil-production-capacity" target="_blank">

</li>
<li>
<p>lots of companies that are considered as big polluters, representants and lobbyists were present. It was estimated that <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/2023/12/record-number-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-granted-access-cop28-climate-talks-0" target="_blank">
    <i>
     2456 lobbyists were present in the COP28 
    </i>
</a>
, which is significantly more than in the COP27 with an estimation of 636 lobbyists and 503 during the COP26.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Sultan Al-Jaber, the president of the COP28, the final text is a success.</p>

</figure> 
<p>This deal is called &ldquo;historic&rdquo; because it mentions, for the first time in all UN climate conferences, the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144742" target="_blank">
    <i>

<figure class="bg-primary p-3 rounded text-white">
    <blockquote>
        <p>"The promises, if they were all fulfilled, would imply a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of around 5% by 2030, and those that are conditional only of 2%, whereas to limit global warming to well below 2°C, emissions would have to be reduced by 25%, or by 43% for 1.5°C. So we can also see a certain number of limits in this text. These limits are financing. Funding for the development of alternatives to fossil fuels, funding for adaptation with a global target that remains low, and funding for loss and damage to help the most vulnerable countries simply to rebuild post-disaster. For this, the $400 million on the table is equivalent to the annual salary of the three highest-paid footballers."</p>

<p>You can be a thinker, a maker, an instigator, an organiser or a facilitator (Arthur Keller - 2022).</p>
<p><strong>The important thing it to stop denying</strong>. If we deeply understand we will act accordingly. Even though Naomi Klein is focused on climate change, this applies for the systemic concern:</p>


<figure class="bg-primary p-3 rounded text-white">
<blockquote>
<p>
A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a 
split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke ("more 
signs of the Apocalypse!"). Which is another way of looking away. <br><br>

Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever 
and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out 
of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover 
while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away. <br><br>

Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it ("dollar for dollar it's more 
efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is 
the best protection from weather extremes") — as if having a few more dollars will 
make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking 
away if you happen to be a policy wonk. <br><br>

Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant 
and abstract — even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, 
and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the 
most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way 
of looking away. <br><br>

Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate 
and shop at farmers' markets and stop driving — but forget trying to actually change 
the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that's too much "bad 
energy" and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, 
because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still 
have one eye tightly shut. <br><br>

Or maybe we do look — really look — but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. 
Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it's hard to keep it 
in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again 
ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that 
letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.
